# Time Series PHP Library Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
[ ] 1. Implement a consistent error handling strategy across all drivers
   - Ensure all drivers throw appropriate exceptions with meaningful messages
   - Add exception documentation in PHPDoc comments

[ ] 2. Enhance the query builder interface
   - Add more fluent methods for common query operations
   - Implement query validation before execution

[ ] 3. Add a caching layer for query results
   - Implement time-based cache invalidation
   - Add support for different cache backends (in-memory, Redis, etc.)

## Code Quality and Testing
[ ] 4. Increase test coverage to at least 90%
   - Add more unit tests for edge cases
   - Implement integration tests for each driver

[ ] 5. Implement static analysis improvements
   - Add strict type declarations to all methods
   - Define and enforce array shapes for data structures

[ ] 6. Refactor code to use PHP 8.2 features
   [x] Implement readonly properties where appropriate
   [x] Use newer methods such as str_contains, str_starts_with, and str_ends_with
   [x] Use the match statement where appropriate
   [x] Implement constructor property promotion
   [x] Use union types and intersection types make sure types are ordered consistently to ease searchability
   [x] Implement enumerations (enum) for type-safe constants
   [ ] Use the null coalescing operator (??) and nullsafe operator (?->)
   [ ] Implement first-class callable syntax
   [ ] Use readonly classes where appropriate
   [ ] Implement the new in array initialization syntax
   [ ] Use typed properties with proper PHPDoc array shapes
   [ ] Implement the new DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) types
   [ ] Use the never return type for methods that always throw exceptions

[ ] 7. Improve code documentation
   - Add comprehensive PHPDoc comments to all classes and methods
   - Create usage examples for each driver

[ ] 8. Implement performance benchmarks
    - Create benchmark scripts for common operations
    - Compare performance between different drivers

## Driver Improvements
[ ] 9. Standardize driver implementations
    - Ensure consistent method signatures across drivers
    - Implement all interface methods in each driver

[ ] 10. Add support for additional time series databases
    - Implement a driver for TimescaleDB
    - Implement a driver for OpenTSDB

[ ] 11. Enhance RRDtool driver
    - Improve tag handling mechanism
    - Add support for RRDtool's advanced features

[ ] 12. Optimize InfluxDB driver
    - Implement batch operations for better performance
    - Add support for InfluxDB's latest query language features

[ ] 13. Improve Prometheus driver
    - Add support for Prometheus' remote write API
    - Implement more query types

[ ] 13. Implement a retry mechanism
    - job interface and possible trait
    - limit and backoff
    - persist to cache (requires serializable jobs) for playback when online again

## Configuration and Usability
[ ] 14. Enhance configuration system
    - Implement environment variable support for configuration
    - Add validation for configuration values

[ ] 15. Improve error messages and debugging
    - Add detailed context to exception messages
    - Implement a debug mode with verbose logging

[ ] 16. Create a command-line interface
    - Implement commands for common operations
    - Add support for running queries from the command line

[ ] 17. Implement automatic schema management
    - Add support for creating and updating database schemas
    - Implement migration tools for schema changes

[ ] 18. Enhance Laravel integration
    - Improve the Laravel service provider
    - Add more Laravel-specific convenience methods

## Documentation and Examples
[ ] 19. Create comprehensive documentation
    - Write detailed API documentation
    - Add tutorials for common use cases

[ ] 20. Develop example applications
    - Create a simple dashboard application
    - Implement examples for each supported database

[ ] 21. Add performance tuning guidelines
    - Document best practices for each driver
    - Provide configuration recommendations

[ ] 22. Create migration guides
    - Document how to migrate between different time series databases
    - Provide tools to assist with migration

[ ] 23. Implement a documentation website
    - Create a searchable documentation site
    - Add interactive examples
